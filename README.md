Samples projects for the Snapback SDK

Read full documentation at developer.snapback.io.

In order to compile the projects properly, remember to add our SDK library jar file in libs project directory and add library references where required:
- appcompat v7 library support for OrientedKeyGamepad
- Atooma SDK (http://www.atooma.com/developers#home) for our Atooma plugin
