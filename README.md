===================

Samples projects for the Snapback SDK.

Read full documentation at http://developer.snapback.io

In order to compile the projects properly, remember to add our SDK library jar file in *libs* project directory and add library references where required, for instance:
- for **OrientedKeyGamepad** sample you need *appcompat v7 library support* (automatically genereted in Eclipse enviroment);
- for **AtoomaPlugin** sample you need the *Atooma SDK* (http://www.atooma.com/developers#home).
